## Usage

Create your Statamic [forms](https://statamic.dev/forms#content) as usual. Don't forget to add the consent field to your blueprint.

### Interests
You will need to know the `id`s of the interests in order to add them to your form:

``` html
<div class="form-group">
    <label>Interests</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="4e4b2bc6ae" class="form-control"/>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="3e1e51dbae" class="form-control"/>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="f79652f791" class="form-control"/>
</div>
```

To get those IDs, first run `php artisan mailchimp:groups your_form_handle` to get the group ids. Then run `php artisan mailchimp:interests your_form_handle the_group_id` to get the list of interests and their ID. Use those ids in your template (example above).

The interests field in your form blueprint should end up looking something like this (assuming you use the default `interests` as your fields' handle:

``` yaml
-
  handle: interests
  field:
    options:
      e25a8f41d6: 'Interest group 1'
      cd1g2413a2: 'Interest group 2'
      1b1a842842: 'Interest group 3'
    type: checkboxes
```

### Marketing Permissions

To work with Mailchimp's [Marketing Permissions](https://mailchimp.com/help/collect-consent-with-gdpr-forms/) you need to do a few things:

1. Get your permissions and ids by running `php artisan mailchimp:permissions {form-handle}` for each of the forms that are in Mailchimp. For example, mine look like:

```
‚ùØ php please mailchimp:permissions contact_us
+-------------------------------+------------+
| Marketing Permission          | ID         |
+-------------------------------+------------+
| Email                         | 2d904xxxxx |
| Customized Online Advertising | 3560exxxxx |
+-------------------------------+------------+
```

2. Add those Mailchimp's config
3. Add the form field that will have those permissions

![permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silentzco/statamic-mailchimp/main/images/marketing-permissions.png).

Then in your form, have fields like this:
```
<div class="form-group">
    <label>GDPR</label>
    <label for=""email>Email</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="gdpr[email]" value="true" class="form-control"/>
    <label for=""email>Online</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="gdpr[customized_online_advertising]" value="true" class="form-control"/>
</div>
```

Don't forget to add the `gdpr` field to your form's blueprint.

## Testing
