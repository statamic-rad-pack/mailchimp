# Manage Mailchimp newsletters in Statamic
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/silentzco/statamic-mailchimp.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/silentzco/statamic-mailchimp/releases)

This package provides an easy way to integrate MailChimp with Statamic forms and user registrations.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4+
* Statamic v3.2+

## Updating from < 2.2

The package name changed, so to update please run `composer remove edalzell/mailchimp` then follow the instructions below.

## Installation

You can install this package via composer using:

```bash
composer require silentz/mailchimp
```

The package will automatically register itself.

## Configuration

Set your Mailchimp API Key in your `.env` file. You can get it from: https://us10.admin.mailchimp.com/account/api-key-popup/.

```yaml
MAILCHIMP_APIKEY=your-key-here
```

To publish the config file to `config/mailchimp.php` run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mailchimp-config"
```

This will publish a file with the following contents:
```php
return [

    'api_key' => env('MAILCHIMP_APIKEY'),

## Usage

Create your Statamic [forms](https://statamic.dev/forms#content) as usual. Don't forget to add the consent field to your blueprint.

**NOTE**: If you are using groups you will need to know the `id`s of the interests in order to add them to your form:

``` html
<div class="form-group">
    <label>Interests</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="4e4b2bc6ae" class="form-control"/>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="3e1e51dbae" class="form-control"/>
    <input type="checkbox" name="interests[]" value="f79652f791" class="form-control"/>
</div>
```

To get those IDs, first run `php artisan mailchimp:groups your_form_handle` to get the group ids. Then run `php artisan mailchimp:interests your_form_handle the_group_id` to get the list of interests and their ID. Use those ids in your template (example above).

The interests field in your form blueprint should end up looking something like this (assuming you use the default `interests` as your fields' handle:

``` yaml
-
  handle: interests
  field:
    options:
      e25a8f41d6: 'Interest group 1'
      cd1g2413a2: 'Interest group 2'
      1b1a842842: 'Interest group 3'
    type: checkboxes
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
